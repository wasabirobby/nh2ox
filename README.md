# nh2ox

## About
I've helped a few convert their menus/inputs from nh to ox_lib and got lazy so I put this together to provide a compatibility wrapper of sorts while you convert your scripts.
This will work with v1 and v2 versions of nh-context/keyboard so any script requiring these scripts will work by default with ox_lib/this resource.

## How to use

- Put resource in and ensure *after* ox_lib
- Completely remove `nh-context` from server

# WIP - Still working on `nh-keyboard` in this
